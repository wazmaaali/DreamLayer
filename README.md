## What is DreamLayer AI?

DreamLayer AI is an open-source Stable Diffusion WebUI that keeps the familiar Automatic1111 ‚ÅÑ Forge layout you know, replaces the clutter with a modern design system, and runs every generation step on ComfyUI in the background.  
No node graph on screen, no server rental, just a lightning-fast local interface for:

* **AI artists** producing portfolio-ready images  
* **Developers and prompt engineers** iterating on prompts and LoRAs  
* **Researchers** benchmarking new models and samplers  

> **Status:** ‚ú® **Now live:** Open Alpha ‚Ä¢ **Beta V1 ships:** **Mid-July 2025**

> ‚≠ê Star the repo for updates & to get early-supporter perks

## Quick Start

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Run with Cursor (Smooth Setup with a Few Clicks)

Easiest way to run DreamLayer üòÉ Best for non-technical users

1. **Download this repo**
2. **Open the folder in [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/)** (an AI-native code editor)
3. Type `run it` or press the **"Run"** button ‚Äî then follow the guided steps

Cursor will:
- Walk you through each setup step
- Install Python and Node dependencies
- Create a virtual environment
- Start the backend and frontend
- Output a **localhost:8080** link you can open in your browser

‚è±Ô∏è Takes about 5-10 minutes. No terminal needed. Just click, run, and you‚Äôre in. üöÄ

> On macOS, PyTorch setup may take a few retries. Just keep pressing **Run** when prompted. Cursor will guide you through it.

### Installation

**linux:**
```bash
./install_linux_dependencies.sh
```

**macOS:**
```bash
./install_mac_dependencies.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
install_windows_dependencies.ps1
```

### Start Application

**linux:**
```bash
./start_dream_layer.sh
```

**macOS:**
```bash
./start_dream_layer.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
start_dream_layer.bat
```
### Env Variables
**install_dependencies_linux**
DLVENV_PATH // preferred path to python virtual env. default is /tmp/dlvenv

**start_dream_layer**
DREAMLAYER_COMFYUI_CPU_MODE // if no nvidia drivers available run using CPU only.  default is false

### Access

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:8080
- **ComfyUI:** http://localhost:8188


### Installing Models ‚≠êÔ∏è

DreamLayer ships without weights to keep the download small. You have two ways to add models:

### a) Closed-source API models

DreamLayer can also call external APIs (OpenAI¬†DALL¬∑E, Flux, Ideogram). 

To enable them:

Edit your `.env` file at `dream_layer/.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
BFL_API_KEY=flux-...
IDEOGRAM_API_KEY=id-...
```

Once a key is present, the model becomes visible in the dropdown.
No key = feature stays hidden.

### b) Open-source checkpoints (offline)

**Step 1:** Download .safetensors or .ckpt files from:
- Hugging Face
- Civitai
- Your own training runs

**Step 2:** Place the models in the appropriate folders (auto-created on first run):
- Checkpoints/ ‚Üí # full checkpoints (.safetensors)
- Lora/ ‚Üí # LoRA & LoCon files
- ControlNet/ ‚Üí # ControlNet models
- VAE/ ‚Üí # optional VAEs

**Step 3:** Click Settings ‚ñ∏ Refresh Model List in the UI ‚Äî the models appear in dropdowns.

> Tip: Use symbolic links if your checkpoints live on another drive.

*The installation scripts will automatically install all dependencies and set up the environment.*
